# asciigol: ASCII Game of Life

An implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) animated as ASCII in the terminal.

The current implementation allows for random initial state. However, fixed initial state is possible and will be implemented in future.
